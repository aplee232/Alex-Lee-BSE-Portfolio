This folder contains the schematic and code for the ball tracking robot as well as the schematic for the robot arm. The schematic for the robot differs slightly from what I built; the left and right ultrasonic sensors were removed (they do not do anything in the code), the breadboard is powered by the Raspberry Pi using power pin 2 and ground pin 6, the H-bridge (IN1-IN4) are conneted to pins 31, 33, 35, 37 and the H-bridge port on the same side as the those pins is connected to ground pin 9 on the Raspberry Pi. The code for the robot essentially works by filtering out colors so only the red ball is detected, communicating with the ultrasonic sensor to find out where the ball is, then to the motors move the robot towards the ball. The schematic for the arm is exactly how I built it, and the code can be found on the official Github of the arm which can be found in the link at the bottom of my portfolio.
